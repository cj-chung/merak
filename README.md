A Large-scale Cloud Emulator provides ability to
- emulate data center physical topologies and network devices including hosts, switches, and routers.
- emulate a large volume of compute nodes (more than 100K) with limited physical hardware resources.
- conduct the performance test for a target project's (e.g., Alcor) control plane with a large-size of VPC having more than 1M VMs.
- automatically create and conduct different performance test scenarios and collect results.
